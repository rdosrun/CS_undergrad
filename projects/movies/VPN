For this guide I will list out a couple of options for the deployment of a self hosted VPN service

****Disclamer****
    For those looking for an anomous way to browse the web this is will not help with that.
    if you are looking to be anonymous online I would suggest the following (make sure to read all suggestions)
        1. Use tor browser/ the onion network for that
        2. Do not sign in to any website that has your personal information tied to an account, youtube/email/bank ... ect
        3. Only access your anonymous acccounts through the tor network
        4. Do not make any purchases unless you are using monero(XMR)
        5. Only use linux based Operating systems.
    If the above doesn't sound reasonable I would suggest using firefox as a browser, duckduckgo as a search engine, and install a decent ad blocker
    that will do 75% of what the above will do and more likely than not provide what you are looking for.

****Warning****
    doing this will open up your network to external traffic make sure to keep your VPN up to date and follow best operational security practices


if you are looking for a basic vpn I would suggest using an older computer install a couple of network cards and use pfsense
